## Introduction

A simple yet powerful drowsiness detection model with an accuracy of 97% developed using Machine Learning that detects eye state as "Open" or "Closed", which is helpful in detecting drowsiness among drivers. 

## Usage

To use our drowsiness detection model:
  1. Simply clone or download and unzip the repository.
  2. Install tensorflow, cv2, and other modules as required in your system using pip (You can cross-check the modules used in the respective .ipynb files       and install required ones).
  3. Run the gui.py file.
  4. The OpenCV window will open and automatically detect eye state (Ensure proper lighting before detection).
